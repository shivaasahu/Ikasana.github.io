        <h1>Ikasana</h1>
        <p>Ikasana is a foundation dedicated to bring a revolution in an individual's inner self by allowing them to engineer themselves, connect to a different dimension, to be able to identify with the whole world of advanced beings, and discover their
            actual potential.
            <br> Peace of mind, serenity, and calmness are descriptions of a disposition free from the effects of stress. In some cultures, inner peace is considered a state of consciousness or enlightenment that may be cultivated by various forms of
            training, such as breathing exercises, prayer, meditation, tai chi or yoga, for example. Many spiritual practices refer to this peace as an experience of knowing oneself. People have difficulties embracing their inner spirituality because
            everyday stressors get the best of them; finding peace and happiness in the little joys of life can seem difficult, and results do not seem all that gratifying. Achieving spirituality is a step-by-step process; there are ways through which
            one can become more spiritual every day.</p>
